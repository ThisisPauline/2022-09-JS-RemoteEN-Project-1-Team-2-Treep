## Introduction
This website is the first project done at Wild Code School.

The Treep project is a concept project created on an original idea of Pauline Kraus and based on a fictitious NGO whose lifelong goal is to fight the effect of wildfires due to climate change. If the project is still at a conceptual stage, once implemented, it would answer the preoccupations of a client.

The team behind the conception is composed of: Pierre Basck, Osvaldo Felices, Anna Vachluk, Russell James Corpuz and Pauline Kraus.
